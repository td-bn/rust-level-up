# Concurrency is Rust

Definitions:
- **Concurrency**: different parts of a program execute independently
- **Parallel**: differnt parts of a program execute at the same time

### What is special about Rust?
- By leveraging ownership and type-checking many concurrency errors are just compile
time errors in Rust, rather than runtime errors.

Bugs are worked on before production instead of discovering them in production.
